# django_bookstore

Hello Guys, 

I have been working on this project for 2 days now and this is what you need
to know to get things started quickly : 

1. Create a folder for the project. It could be named "web_project" or
whatever names that come to your mind.

2.In that folder, you need to configure a virtual environment with python 3 
Take a look at this -> https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html

3. Please dont push your virtual env to the distant repo, initiliaze your
local repo accordingly.

Ok and now about Django :

- There is an important distinction between an APPLICATION and A PROJECT
in django. The former is where you put your "code". The latter is where you
configure the settings of the project. In our case, the last virtual_library directory in the hierarchy (the second
one) is the project folder. It contains the settings for the project. DONT
PUT CODE IN THAT FOLDER. Search is the only app for the moment.

- If you want to add a feature or a functionnality to the project feel free
to add a new app for the purpose.
